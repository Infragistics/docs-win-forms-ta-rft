= Known Issues of the WinListView

This topic describes known issues related to the WinListView™ control that we became aware of during the development cycle.

== Editing a ListItem

When editing a ListItem, if you double-click the item to enter edit mode, you must do either of the following in order to edit the text:

* Hardcode a "sleep(1)" after the double-click action, and before the text is modified.
* Add a datapool to the embeddable editor to do the text editing on the internal editor.
