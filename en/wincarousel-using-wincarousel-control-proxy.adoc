=== Identifying carousel items

Carousel items are identified by  _Text_  ,  _Name_  ,  _Position_  , and  _Index_  . Priority in recording for the carousel items is:

1.  _Text_   (If not empty)

2.  _Name_   (If not empty)

3.  _Position_  . If the carousel buttons are not visible, it will record identified by  _Index_   instead of Position.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
scrolling with the mouse wheel is not supported, and using  _Position_   does not scroll an item into view.
====

[[_Ref384651973]]

=== Button subitem

There are six possible scroll buttons for the Carousel control allowing to scroll items along the path. Each button is recognized as `AtButton` `(“[button name]”)`.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Button Type|Description

|
[start=1] 

. Scroll button 

|Recorded as: `AtButton``("``FirstItem``")`

|
[start=2] 

. Scroll button 

|Recorded as: `AtButton``("``PreviousPage``")`

|
[start=3] 

. Scroll button 

|Recorded as: `AtButton``("``PreviousItem``")`

=== Text subitem

_Text_   subitem references the `Text` property of the carousel item, which if specified, refers to the visible text on the carousel item. If more than one instance of the  _CarouselItem_   is visible it will interact with the first one on the path. Also if the item is not currently visible it will be scrolled into view.

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtText``("Item1"))`

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtText``("Item1", 1)) ' Click the second instance of Item1`

[[_Ref384651988]]

=== Name subitem

_Name_   subitem references the `Key` property of the carousel item, which can contain duplicates on value null as it is not required to be set. If more than one instance of the  _CarouselItem_   is visible it will interact with the first one on the path. Also if the item is not currently visible it will be scrolled into view.

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtName``("Key1"))`

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtName``("", 1)) ' Click the second instance of an empty key`

[[_Ref384651998]]

=== Position subitem

_Position_   subitem refers to the visible position of the carousel item along the path. It is a zero-based index, based on the visible carousel item `UIElement` sorted on the `ItemInfo.Position` property which is an internal property on the `UIElement` to state where it is on the path. You can also use this if you need to click on a particular instance of a carousel item that appears multiple times along a path.

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtPosition``(3))`

[[_Ref399770724]]

=== Index subitem

_Index_   subitem refers to the zero-based index of the carousel item in the items collection. If more than one instance of the  _CarouselItem_   is visible it will interact with the first one on the path. Also if the item is not currently visible it will be scrolled into view.

`Carousel1ComboListBox().Click(``AtIndex``(0))`
