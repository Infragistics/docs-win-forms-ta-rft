= Known Issues of the WinSchedule

This topic describes a known issue related to the WinSchedule™ control that we became aware of during the development cycle.

== Dragging an Appointment

When dragging an appointment or holiday, if the path to the destination involves scrolling the control then you should replace the Drag action with a MoveAppointment action. This is due to a control behavior which prevents the glass replay of the drag action.
